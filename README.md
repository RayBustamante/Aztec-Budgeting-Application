# Aztec-Budgeting-Application
by Ramon C. Bustamante

This is a student application program that keeps track of user expense and use data analysis to compare user data with other students and provide detailed financial advice for their current situation. It requires the creation of a local student account which ask for the students income, account information and monthly expenses.

Using the inputs provided, this program will try to keep track of all user expenses which will be downloaded into several local csv files containing the purchase information of each category. Additionally, a budget log file containing the contents of a chatbox will be used to display the current purchases made to the user and will be saved to a local txt file that will display whenver new purchases are input. Lastly, it will analyize the data provided with those of your peers and based on the comparison, you may be able to save a document file containing all of your information along with financial advice tailored to your situation by the data provided by the user. The financial advice is created by using an API key from openAI.

This program was created as a final project for my undergraduate program and it is meant to demonstrate my capabilities in using python, API's, Data Analysis, Pandas, matlibplot and Machine Learning Models. 

To run, simply download the entire folder and  run the main.py file. A local account would already have been made in order to bypass the account creation requirements and use the Expense Tracking Tool in the tools menu.
