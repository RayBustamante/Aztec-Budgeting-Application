by Ramon C. Bustamante

This is a student application program that keeps track of user expense and use data analysis to compare user data with other students and provide detailed financial advice for their current situation. It requires the creation of a local student account which ask for the students income, account information and monthly expenses.

Using the inputs provided, this program will try to keep track of all user expenses. Which will be downloaded into several csv files containing purchases. Additionally, a log file containing the chatbox will be saved to a local txt file that will display whenver new purchases are input. Lastly, it will analyize the data provided with those of your peers and based on the comparison, you may be able to save a document file containing all of your information along with A.I generative financial advice tailored to your situation using openAI API's.

This program was created as a final project for my undergraduate program and it is meant to demonstrate my capabilities in using python, API's, Data Analysis, Pandas, matlibplot and Machine Learning Models. 

To run, simply download the entire folder and  run the main.py file.
